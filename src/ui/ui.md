# User Interface 

I3M features an extremely powerful and flexible node-based user interface system. Power and flexibility comes with
a certain price: it has a steep learning curve. This chapter will cover user interface usage in the engine, explain
basic concepts, provide information about most commonly used widgets, and so on.

## Web Demo

You can explore UI system capabilities in this [web demo](https://ithreem.com/assets/demo/ui/index.html). Keep in mind,
