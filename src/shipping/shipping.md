# Shipping

This chapter explains how to build your game for various target platforms. On most platforms (PC, WebAssembly) you can
use automated build system:

The editor provides a special tool that can create a build for shipping in a few clicks. It can be opened by going to
`File -> Export Project...`. At first, you need to select a target platform from the list of available platforms.
Then specify the data folders, ignored extensions of assets, data folders, etc. Finally, click `Export` and wait until
your game build is done. It can take from few minutes to tens of minutes, depending on the size of your game.

See next chapters, to learn more info about desired target platform.
