# Editor

This section of the book covers various aspects of the editor. Keep in mind, that this section covers aspects of the
editor, that does not have direct relations with engine entities. For example, this section covers
[Editor Settings](settings.md), but does not cover [Animation Editor](../animation/anim_editor.md). This is because, it
is better to show how to use a thing from both sides at once (code and editor), than split it to separate sections.

In this section, you'll know how to use editor-specific parts of the engine, how to use special tools it provides.
Check next chapters to learn more about a part that interests you now.
