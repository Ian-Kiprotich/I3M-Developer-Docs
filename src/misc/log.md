# Logging

The engine has built-in logger that allows you to trace execution of your game by creating log entries when needed.

The window allows you to select severity of the messages that will be put in the window:

- `Info+` will show all messages with `Info`, `Warning`, `Error` severities.
- `Warning+` will show all messages with `Warning` and `Error` severities.
- `Error` will show all messages with only `Error` severity.

Each log entry can be copied to the clipboard by right-clicking on it and pressing `Copy` in the context menu. You can
also clear the log using `Clear` button.

## Writing to the log

You can use one of `Log::info`, `Log::warn`, `Log::err` methods, or use `Log::writeln` with severity specified. It is also
possible to select desired severity level:

```rust,no_run
# extern crate i3m;
# use i3m::core::log::{Log, MessageKind};
// These lines will be printed.
Log::info("This is some info");
Log::warn("This is some warning");
Log::err("This is some error");

Log::set_verbosity(MessageKind::Warning);

Log::info("This is some info"); // This won't be printed.
Log::warn("This is some warning");
Log::err("This is some error");
```
